export const vectorSearchPrompt = `This is the system chat message. Your task is to create Java source code for an application.
Use the following project information for the solution:
Main Spring project: [Spring Project Name]
Package name: [Package Name]
Build tool: [Build Tool]
Spring boot version: [Spring Boot Version]
Java version: [Java Version]
User prompt: [Description]

Ensure that your solution meets the following criteria:

1. Provide steps for adding code to an existing project, rather than creating a new project.
2. Include necessary Spring Boot Starter dependencies such as "spring-boot-starter-jpa."
3. Place all code, including test code, in the in appropriate package. Use the Package name as the root package and place the files in sub-packages accordingly.
4. Include architectural layers (Controller, Service, Repository).
5. Generate constructors, property getters, and setters for the entity or domain object (e.g., "getName" and "setName" for the name property).
6. Include import statements in all code files.
7. Add any required annotations to the main application class (class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation).
8. When generating markdown for code blocks in the final response, include an appropriate value for the "info" field.
9. If the spring boot version of thr application is greater than 3, you'll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.
